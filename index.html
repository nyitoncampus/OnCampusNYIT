								<span class="image main"><img src="images/image1.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>New York Institute of Technology is pleased to submit this proposal for services to support a “smooth admissions process”. In achieving our goals for improving an easier transformation, we plan to propose the admissions department to appoint each student a specified advisor who the student can report to at any time. The overall goal for the admission department should be “student transition” through convenience, accuracy, and a timely manner.</p>
								<p>New York Institute of Technology is a private institution that was founded by a gentleman named Alexander Schure in 1955 with the first campus being in the borough of Brooklyn. NYIT has a total enrollment number or 3,575 number of undergraduate students combined throughout all of the campuses. Throughout the suburban setting of the school, it consumes 215 acres of land where the campuses were built/ reconstructed. The New York Institute of Technology was ranked 47 in the 2018 edition of the “Best Colleges in the North. Tuition as of December 13, 2017 still remains $35,870 yearly. NYIT has campuses in Manhattan, Long Island, China, Canada, Abu Dhabi, and United Arab Emirates. NYIT offers many different housing options and student organizations.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/image2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Transitioning to college from high school can be overwhelming and the initial goal is to make us students feel welcome and that we have someone to contact for any questions or concerns. Being a student here who transferred from college, I, myself found the transition process quite difficult, so a group of students and myself decided to come up with a contingency plan to make the process easier and more efficient for peers/ students. We gathered together and brainstormed ways to make this process as simple and sustainable as possible.</p>
								<p>When a student is accepted, they should be appointed an advisor. These advisors should be trained for specific majors. For example, a student who is accepted as a hospitality student in school of management should be assigned an advisor who is trained about the curriculum and has a relationship with the dean and the professors (see chart below as an example). This will make choosing classes easier for students to help fit their needs. There should be at least 3-5 specified advisors for each major.</p>
								<p>The next step is to contact the newly admitted student. This will be a personal phone call congratulating the student for being accepted and welcoming them to our campus. During the phone call, we will: confirm the students name, email, and address. Once we have ended the conversation with the student we will send out an “information pamphlet” which provides them with a step-by-step process for an easier enrollment process as well as building/ room numbers they will need to know.</p>
								<p>Lastly, after receiving the pamphlet, about a week after we will call the student to set up an appointment or a tour if they please. Also, we will have all of this information available with a virtual tour as well as an advisor to answer any questions.</p>
								<p>The overall goal is to create a comfortable connection with the students so that they feel welcome. Making a personal connection will eliminate any means of confusion for the students which will allow them a “smoother transition”.</p>

								<p>Are you worried or stressed out about starting college? What do I have to do next, who do I talk to? Well this proposal will cover everything we as students need to know in order to make our transition an easier process. On behalf on the NYIT students in the FCIQ 101 class, we brainstormed and researched ways in which we can make a valid proposal for an easier admission process.</p>
								<p>There were a lot of questions that would arise as to what the first step to enrollment should be. We thought it would be best if we were assigned to an advisor who would answer any questions or concerns that we had. Being contacted via phone or email (whichever is on file) just to touch base and get to know an advisor and extend a follow up “Welcome to NYIT, you’re accepted”. These advisors who are appointed to the student should be trained properly and know the department dean(s), chair, and all professors. The advisors should then be able to have a flexible schedule in order to meet with the student to speak about further actions they need to take.</p>
								<p>Second, after the phone call, we should be able to have SWAG, whether it’s a magazine, pamphlet or a packet of forms and contact information in the mail stating what needs to be completed (immunization forms, emergency contact information, deadline for semester payments) and where you need to drop off all of these items. This information should be shipped to our houses within no later than a week. Speaking generally, there were some of us who registered late because of misdirection. These specific instructions would eliminate any means of confusion for us students. The overall goal is to create a connection with us students and an advisor where we will feel comfortable when starting classes.</p>
								<p>Third, the advisor should be able to sit with us and help create a schedule that’s best for us. There have been many occasions where students pick classes just because that’s what’s on their class evaluation form for each semester but end up dropping out. This becomes much of a hassle for us students and this issue can be eliminated if we had an advisor who coached us through the admission process. </p>
								<p>In addition, a tour should be scheduled as a communal meeting where all new students in groups of 20 will meet from the same major and go on a tour together. This will not only be another form of an orientation, but students will know where their classes are located and which building they’re in. </p>
								<p>Overall, making a few simple changes can diminish the tension of transition for any incoming students. On behalf of the NYIT students in the FCIQ class we hope this helps the admission department through a student point of view. We hope that this helps our future students to have a “smooth transition”.</p>
